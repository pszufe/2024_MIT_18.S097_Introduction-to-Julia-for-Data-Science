# Introduction to Julia for Data Science
## Classical predictive models (11am – 12:30pm)
Day 2 (Wednesday, Jan 17, 2024)

### Teaching objectives:
- Student will understand and know how to use in Julia Data Generating Process for Linear Regression Model
- Student will know how to estimate in Julia linear regression model using Ordinary Least Square
- Student will know the basic statistical properties of Ordinary Least Square and be able to demonstrate them in Monte Carlo simulations in Julia
- Student will be acquainted with omitted variable problem and its consequences.

### Agenda
1. Theoretical foundations of linear regression model:
    - a. Data Generating Process for Linear Regression Model,
    - b.	Ordinary Least Square estimator and its properties,
    - c.	Interpretation of coefficients and standard errors, p-values for statistical significance testing, as well as R-Squared,
    - d.	Consequence of omitted correlated variable problem.
2. Practical verification of Ordinary Least Squares properties using simulations in Julia:
    - a.	Synthetic data simulation according to linear regression (LR) Data Generating Process,
    - b.	Visualization of simulated data,
    - c.	Linear Regression estimation using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS),
    - d.	Interpretation linear regression results, i.e., estimated coefficients, standard error, p-values, R-squared,
    - e.	Demonstration of unbiasedness OLS property using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations,
    - f.	MC simulations of p-values assuming null hypothesis,
    - g.	Coefficient biasedness due to correlated omitted variable.
