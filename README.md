# MIT_18.S097 Special Subject in Mathematics: Introduction to Julia for Data Science
MIT_18.S097

**Dates:** Jan 16-19, 2024

**Time:** TWRF 11am-12:30pm; 1pm-3pm

**Location**: Matchessusets Institute of Technology, Boston, MA, USA

**Room:** This class will meet in 2-132. See http://whereis.mit.edu/?mapterms=2-132 for location.



Data analysis has become one of the core processes in virtually any professional activity. The collection of data becomes easier and less expensive, so we have ample access to it.

The Julia language, which was designed to address the typical challenges that data scientists face when using other tools. Julia is like Python, in that it supports an efficient and convenient development process. At the same time, programs developed in Julia have performance comparable to C.

During this short course, you will learn how to build data science models using Julia. Moreover, we will teach you how to scale your computations beyond a single computer.

This course does not require the participants to have prior detailed knowledge of advanced machine learning algorithms nor the Julia programming language. What we assume is a basic knowledge of data science tools (like Python or R) and techniques (like linear regression, basic statistics, plotting).

<!--
**Installation instructions**
Installation instructions can be found in [materials for the day 1](Day-1a_Your-first-steps-with-Julia/)

Once installed the code can be run as
```
using Pkg
Pkg.activate(".") # assumes running the code in the main folder of this repository
using IJulia
notebook(dir=".")
```

**Grading**

You can register for this course for credit. The contact point regarding the registration process is Professor Alan
Edelman, Julia Lab Research Group Leader. The evaluation of the course will be based on assessment of a homework that will be distributed during the last
day of the course and should be sent back to Przemys≈Çaw Szufel (pszufe@sgh.waw.pl) no later than after one
week.

This course has been supported by the Polish  National Agency for Academic Exchange under  the Strategic Partnerships programme, grant  number BPI/PST/2021/1/00069/U/00001.
